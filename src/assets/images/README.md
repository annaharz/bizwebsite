# Website Images

This folder contains images used throughout the Lisa Tattoo website.

## Guidelines for Images

- Use optimized images to ensure fast loading times
- Recommended formats: WebP (preferred), JPG, or PNG
- Keep file sizes under 500KB when possible
- Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `tattoo-ginkgo-leaf.webp` instead of `img1.webp`)
- For portfolio images, maintain consistent aspect ratios

## Folder Structure

- `/portfolio/` - Tattoo portfolio images
- `/backgrounds/` - Background images used throughout the site
- `/icons/` - Custom icons (if not using SVG inline)
- `/about/` - Images for the About page

## Image Optimization

Before adding images to the website, consider optimizing them with tools like:
- [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/)
- [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/)
- [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/)

This helps maintain fast loading times and a better user experience.
